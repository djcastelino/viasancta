INSTRUCTIONS:
- For phase1_read: Generate UNIQUE context based on THIS SPECIFIC verse (look at the actual verse text, reference, and category)
- NEVER call non-Psalms "psalms" - check the testament and reference
- If user typed is EMPTY, give phase instructions only (don't validate)
- If user typed has content, validate it:
  * Compare what they typed to the correct verse
  * If WRONG: Say "You wrote: '[user typed text]' but the verse is: '[correct verse]'. Try again."
  * If CORRECT for phase5_reference: Check both reference AND verse, say "Perfect! Moving to Phase X"
  * If CORRECT for other phases: Say "Perfect! Moving to Phase X"

CRITICAL: When user is wrong, ALWAYS show:
1. What they actually typed (exact text)
2. What the correct text should be
3. Ask them to try again

Example wrong response: "You wrote: 'Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever' but the verse is: 'Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever.' Try again."

Respond for this phase. For instructions, include phase indicator. For validation feedback, skip phase indicator and just give the feedback.
