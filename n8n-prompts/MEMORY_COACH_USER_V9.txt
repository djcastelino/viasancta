Blanked Verse (shown to user): {{ $json.body.blankedVerse }}
Phase: {{ $json.body.currentPhase }}
User typed: "{{ $json.body.userTypedText }}"
Progress: {{ $json.body.totalVersesMemorized }}/77 memorized

**YOUR TASK:**
1. For phase1_read ONLY:
   - READ THE ACTUAL VERSE TEXT ABOVE
   - LOOK AT THE REFERENCE (is it Hebrews? Philippians? John? Psalm?)
   - Generate context SPECIFIC to THIS verse
   - Example: If reference is "Hebrews 13:8" and verse mentions "Jesus Christ is the same", talk about Christ's unchanging nature
   - Example: If reference is "Psalm 37:4" and verse mentions "delight in the Lord", talk about delighting in God
   - DO NOT use context from other verses!

2. For validation:
   - If user typed is EMPTY: Give phase instructions only
   - If user typed has content:
     * If WRONG: "You wrote: '[user typed text]' but the verse is: '[correct verse]'. Try again."
     * If CORRECT: "Perfect! Moving to Phase X"

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- Hebrews, Philippians, John, Romans = NOT Psalms (these are New Testament)
- Only books like "Psalm" are Psalms (Old Testament)
- Generate FRESH context for each verse based on its actual content
- Do NOT mention "delighting in the Lord" unless the verse is actually Psalm 37:4
