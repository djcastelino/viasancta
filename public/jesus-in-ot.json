God promises that a descendant of 'the woman' (Mary, the new Eve) will crush Satan's head, though the serpent will strike his heel. The cross is where Jesus crushed Satan's power, though he suffered in the process. Catholic theology sees Mary as the new Eve - where Eve disobeyed and brought death, Mary obeyed ('Let it be done to me') and brought life through Jesus. Her Immaculate Conception (freedom from original sin) was necessary to be the new Eve who reverses the curse.",

Like Jesus, Job was mocked and accused falsely. Job said 'my Redeemer lives' - Jesus IS the living Redeemer. Job believed he would see God 'in my flesh' after death - prophesying bodily resurrection through Christ. Job's sufferings were redemptive, pointing to Christ's redemptive suffering. The three friends represent those who misunderstand suffering; the fourth friend Elihu speaks truth, prefiguring Christ who reveals suffering's meaning. The Mass unites our sufferings to Christ's (offering ourselves with the host), transforming pain into redemption just as Job's suffering ended in restoration.",

Wisdom prepares meat and wine and sets her table - Jesus prepares the altar for Mass.

All the Teacher's searching 'under the sun' is fulfilled when the Son rises. Every 'vanity' Ecclesiastes laments (pleasure, work, wisdom, wealth) cannot satisfy because only God can fill the God-shaped hole in our hearts.

Both saw their sons die (the Shunammite's son literally; Mary's son on the cross). Both maintained faith in tragedy - 'It is well' even when it seemed impossible. The Shunammite's son was raised on the third day of her journey; Jesus rose on the third day. Her persistence in seeking Elisha mirrors Mary's intercession - she knew where help came from. At Mass, Mary presents our needs to Jesus just as the Shunammite presented her need to Elisha. Both mothers show us that resurrection hope persists through death. The Rosary teaches us Mary's 'It is well' even at the foot of the cross.",

The 'choice, tender calf' points to Jesus, the sacrificial Lamb. Notice 'they ate' - God shares a meal with Abraham! This foreshadows the Eucharist where God shares himself as food. The icon of the Trinity by Rublev depicts this scene with a chalice on the table - the Church has always seen Eucharistic symbolism here.

Every Catholic church and altar must be consecrated by a bishop before Mass can be celebrated there. The altar is anointed with sacred chrism (like the altar in the rededication). This makes it holy - set apart for the Eucharistic sacrifice. The 'songs and harps and lutes' prefigure beautiful liturgical music at Mass. We celebrate church dedications annually - the 'birthday' of the church. But the greatest dedication happened when Jesus said 'This is my body' - dedicating bread to become his Body forever. Every consecration re-enacts this supreme dedication. The altar is sacred because Jesus becomes present on it.",

He makes us 'lie down' - rest in him. The Eucharist is how the Good Shepherd feeds his flock. Just as a shepherd provides food, Jesus provides himself as food.

He drank the cup of God's wrath against sin so we could drink the cup of salvation (Psalm 116:13). Now we drink the chalice of his Blood - not wrath but love.

They anoint with blessed oil and pray. This sacrament has three effects: 1) Forgives venial sins (and mortal sins if the person can't confess), 2) Gives grace to bear illness patiently, 3) Sometimes restores physical health if it serves spiritual good. Don't wait until the person is unconscious or dying - anoint when they're seriously ill. The sacrament can be repeated during the same illness if condition worsens. Many Catholics neglect this sacrament, but it's powerful. Jesus healed the sick and commissioned the apostles to do likewise (Mark 6:13).

They can't yet have faith, but the Church believes on their behalf (as godparents and parents promise at baptism). Baptism isn't dependent on the recipient's faith but on Christ's power and the Church's faith. Infants who die unbaptized are entrusted to God's mercy, but the Church strongly urges baptizing infants soon after birth. Why deprive them of grace?

But the Bible affirms we DO have an altar. It's the table where Jesus' one sacrifice is made present. Old covenant priests couldn't 'eat' from Christian altars because they rejected Christ. The altar is where heaven and earth meet. Catholic altars are consecrated and often contain relics of martyrs, connecting us to the saints. 'Those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat' - only those in communion with the Catholic Church should receive. This is why we practice 'closed Communion' - you must be Catholic in state of grace. It's not exclusion but protection and respect for the Eucharist's meaning.",

    "otText": "The LORD said to Moses, 'Make a snake and put it up on a pole; anyone who is bitten can look at it and live.' So Moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole. Then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake, they lived.",
    "historicalContext": "When poisonous snakes attacked Israel, God commanded Moses to lift up a bronze serpent; looking at it brought healing.",
    "howItPointsToJesus": "Jesus said, 'Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him' (John 3:14-15). The bronze serpent = Jesus on the cross. 'Look and live' = gaze upon Jesus crucified (and risen) and receive life. At every Mass, we 'look' at Jesus lifted up (elevated during consecration) and receive life through Communion. The Eucharist is our 'looking' - we gaze with faith at the Host and live. In Eucharistic Adoration, we literally 'look' at Jesus exposed in the monstrance. St. John Vianney called Adoration 'holy gazing' - we look at Jesus; he looks at us. This looking heals spiritual poison (sin). Look to Jesus in the sacraments and live!",

EUCHARIST sustains life ('I am the living bread... whoever eats will live forever' - John 6:51). CONFESSION restores life after mortal sin. 'Hold fast to him' - frequent sacramental reception is 'holding fast.' 'For the LORD is your life' - Jesus IS our life, not just our teacher or helper. Without him we're spiritually dead. This is why the Church teaches the sacraments are necessary for salvation - they're channels of Christ's life. Choose life every day by going to Mass, receiving Communion, going to Confession. Avoid death (mortal sin). The choice is daily: life or death, sacraments or sin. Choose life!",

'Yields fruit in season' - the fruits of the Spirit (Gal 5:22-23) emerge from sacramental life. 'Leaf does not wither' - even in trials, grace sustains us. 'Whatever they do prospers' - not worldly success, but spiritual fruitfulness. Saints who lived sacramentally (daily Mass, frequent Confession) bore extraordinary fruit.

You can't know the Eucharist by reading about it; you must taste it. This verse is often used at First Communion celebrations. Non-Catholics sometimes ask 'How do you know Jesus is really present?' Catholics respond: 'Taste and see!' Millions of saints over 2000 years have tasted and testified. Eucharistic miracles visible confirm what faith knows. The LORD is good - supremely so in giving himself as food. 'Takes refuge in him' - the Eucharist is our refuge. When storms come, receive Jesus. Let him be your shelter.

'Know that I am God' - in the silence, we encounter the great I AM truly present. Contemplative prayer before the Eucharist deepens faith. Many testimonies describe encountering God's presence in Adoration. After receiving Communion, be still - don't rush out. Give Jesus a few minutes. Thank him, talk to him, be silent with him. 'I will be exalted' - when we genuflect, kneel, and adore the Eucharist, we exalt Jesus. The monstrance elevates/exalts him. All seven sacraments exalt Jesus - they're channels of his glory.

St. John Vianney spent 16+ hours daily in church. St. Padre Pio heard confessions all day and celebrated long Masses. They knew one day in God's courts was worth everything.
