Her Immaculate Conception (freedom from original sin) was necessary to be the new Eve who reverses the curse.",

On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off. Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the ass; I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come again to you.” And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it on Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So they went both of them together. And Isaac said to his father Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here am I, my son.” He said, “Behold, the fire and the wood; but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” Abraham said, “God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.” So they went both of them together. When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. Then Abraham put forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. But the angel of the Lord called to him from heaven, and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he said, “Here am I.” He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son, from me.” And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him was a ram, caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered it up as a burnt offering instead of his son. So Abraham called the name of that place The Lord will provide; as it is said to this day, “On the mount of the Lord it shall be provided.” Read full chapter Footnotes22. Isaac, carrying the wood up the mountain for the sacrifice, has often been seen as a figure of Christ carrying his cross to die on Golgotha. Genesis 22: Or see Genesis 22: Or he will be seen",

Isaac asks 'where is the lamb?' and Abraham says 'God will provide' - prophesying that God would provide His own Son as the sacrifice. Mount Moriah is where Jerusalem and the Temple were later built - where Jesus was sacrificed. At every Catholic Mass, this same sacrifice is re-presented (not repeated) on our altars. The priest stands in persona Christi, making present the one eternal sacrifice of Calvary. We receive Jesus, the Lamb of God, in the Eucharist.",

    "otText": "Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more. He said to them, “Hear this dream which I have dreamed: behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf.” His brothers said to him, “Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?” So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words. Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?” And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind. Joseph Is Sold by His Brothers12 Now his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. And Israel said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Here I am.” So he said to him, “Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem. And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, “What are you seeking?” “I am seeking my brothers,” he said, “tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock.” And the man said, “They have gone away, for I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan. They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him. They said to one another, “Here comes this dreamer. Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams.” But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, “Let us not take his life.” And Reuben said to them, “Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him”—that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father. So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore; and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it. Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ish′maelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt. Then Judah said to his brothers, “What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? Come, let us sell him to the Ish′maelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh.” And his brothers heeded him. Then Mid′ianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ish′maelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.

And that thou mayest find that it is so, behold the head of Holofernes, who in the contempt of his pride despised the God of Israel, and threatened thee with death, saying: When the people of Israel shall be taken, I will command thy sides to be pierced with a sword. Then Achior, seeing the head of Holofernes, being seized with a great fear he fell on his face upon the earth, and his soul swooned away.

In every Catholic Mass, we are mystically present at Calvary. Christ's one sacrifice is re-presented (made present again) in an unbloody manner. When we receive the Eucharist, we receive the Body that was pierced, the Blood that was shed. We participate in the very sacrifice foretold in Psalm 22.",

St. John Vianney said, 'If we really understood the Mass, we would die of joy.' One hour of adoration before the Blessed Sacrament is 'better than a thousand elsewhere.'

When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the earth, and said, “My lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant. Let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree, while I fetch a morsel of bread, that you may refresh yourselves, and after that you may pass on—since you have come to your servant.” So they said, “Do as you have said.” And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.” And Abraham ran to the herd, and took a calf, tender and good, and gave it to the servant, who hastened to prepare it. Then he took curds, and milk, and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree while they ate.

'You forgave the guilt of my sin' - Confession removes both the guilt AND eternal punishment of mortal sin (temporal punishment may remain, removed by penance, indulgences, or purgatory). The relief David felt is what Catholics experience after Confession - peace, lightness, joy. Don't let shame keep you from this sacrament. The priest has heard it all. Your worst sin isn't shocking to God or his priest. Confession is where mercy flows abundantly.",

    "howItPointsToJesus": "'Taste and see' - this is the invitation to HOLY COMMUNION. We literally taste Jesus (under the appearance of bread/wine) and see that he is good. You can't know the Eucharist by reading about it; you must taste it. This verse is often used at First Communion celebrations. Non-Catholics sometimes ask 'How do you know Jesus is really present?' Catholics respond: 'Taste and see!' Millions of saints over 2000 years have tasted and testified. Eucharistic miracles visible confirm what faith knows. The LORD is good - supremely so in giving himself as food. 'Takes refuge in him' - the Eucharist is our refuge. When storms come, receive Jesus. Let him be your shelter. Taste and see - don't just hear about it. Receive him frequently and you'll know experientially that the LORD is good.",

    "howItPointsToJesus": "'Be still' - Eucharistic Adoration requires stillness. In our noisy world, silence before the Blessed Sacrament is countercultural but essential. 'Know that I am God' - in the silence, we encounter the great I AM truly present. Contemplative prayer before the Eucharist deepens faith. Many testimonies describe encountering God's presence in Adoration. After receiving Communion, be still - don't rush out. Give Jesus a few minutes. Thank him, talk to him, be silent with him. 'I will be exalted' - when we genuflect, kneel, and adore the Eucharist, we exalt Jesus. The monstrance elevates/exalts him. All seven sacraments exalt Jesus - they're channels of his glory. But especially in Adoration, we fulfill 'be still and know.' Make time for Eucharistic Adoration. Be still. Know. Worship.",

'House of my God' = every Catholic church where the Blessed Sacrament is reserved. 'Doorkeeper' - the lowest position in God's house beats the highest position elsewhere. Saints understood this. St. John Vianney spent 16+ hours daily in church. St. Padre Pio heard confessions all day and celebrated long Masses. They knew one day in God's courts was worth everything. If we truly grasped what we have in the Eucharist, we'd never miss Mass. We'd hunger for daily Mass. We'd make time for Adoration.

'His surpassing greatness' - the greatest act of God is the Incarnation and giving us the Eucharist. 'Let everything that has breath' - all the baptized should praise God through sacramental worship.
