    "historicalContext": "Job, a righteous man, suffered terribly though innocent. In his darkest hour, he proclaimed faith in a living Redeemer and bodily resurrection.",
    "howItPointsToJesus": "Job is one of the clearest types of Christ in the OT. Like Jesus, Job was innocent yet suffered immensely. Like Jesus, Job was betrayed by friends. Like Jesus, Job was mocked and accused falsely. Job said 'my Redeemer lives' - Jesus IS the living Redeemer. Job believed he would see God 'in my flesh' after death - prophesying bodily resurrection through Christ. Job's sufferings were redemptive, pointing to Christ's redemptive suffering. The three friends represent those who misunderstand suffering; the fourth friend Elihu speaks truth, prefiguring Christ who reveals suffering's meaning. The Mass unites our sufferings to Christ's (offering ourselves with the host), transforming pain into redemption just as Job's suffering ended in restoration.",

    "howItPointsToJesus": "This is a prophecy of the Eucharist! Wisdom invites us to 'eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed' - Jesus said 'Take and eat, this is my body... Take and drink, this is my blood.' The Church Fathers saw this as prefiguring the Eucharistic banquet. Wisdom builds her house on seven pillars (Prov 9:1) - the Church built on seven sacraments! Wisdom prepares meat and wine and sets her table - Jesus prepares the altar for Mass. Wisdom sends out her servants to invite people - Jesus sends out priests to celebrate Mass and distribute Holy Communion. To feast with Wisdom is to receive Christ in the Eucharist. Every Mass is Wisdom's feast where we eat Christ, the Bread of Life.",

    "howItPointsToJesus": "Ecclesiastes reveals humanity's problem: we have 'eternity in our hearts' but cannot satisfy it with earthly things. This hunger for eternity finds its answer in Christ alone. Jesus is what makes life meaningful - he came to give us 'abundant life' (John 10:10). All the Teacher's searching 'under the sun' is fulfilled when the Son rises. Every 'vanity' Ecclesiastes laments (pleasure, work, wisdom, wealth) cannot satisfy because only God can fill the God-shaped hole in our hearts. The Eucharist is where eternity touches time - the eternal sacrifice of Calvary made present. When we receive Jesus, we receive Eternity itself. Augustine said 'Our hearts are restless until they rest in you' - Ecclesiastes shows the restlessness, Jesus gives the rest.",

Paul says 'Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her' (Eph 5:25) - this is the love Song of Songs celebrates. The bridegroom seeks his beloved; Jesus seeks us. The bride says 'I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine' - this is the intimacy Jesus offers in the Eucharist. When we receive Holy Communion, we literally become one with Jesus - 'I am his and he is mine.' The marriage supper of the Lamb (Rev 19) that we anticipate in heaven begins now at every Mass. St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila used Song of Songs to describe mystical union with Christ in prayer, especially after receiving the Eucharist. The bridal chamber is the tabernacle; the wedding feast is the Mass.",
