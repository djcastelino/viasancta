    "howItPointsToJesus": "This is one of the clearest prophecies of resurrection. The dry bones represent death and hopelessness; Jesus brings resurrection and hope. God breathed life into the bones; Jesus breathed the Holy Spirit on the disciples (John 20:22). This vision prefigures the general resurrection when Christ returns. But it's also sacramental - in Baptism, we who were 'dead in sins' receive spiritual life. In Confession, dry bones of sin are restored to life. Most powerfully, the Eucharist is where Life himself enters our mortal bodies. Jesus said his flesh gives life to the world. When we receive Holy Communion, Christ's living flesh joins to our flesh, his bones to our bones, planting resurrection in us.",

Whoever believes in me... rivers of living water will flow from within them' (John 7:37-38). When the soldier pierced Jesus' side, water and blood flowed out - the Church Fathers saw this as the birth of the sacraments. The river from the temple is the grace of the sacraments flowing from Christ. Baptism (water) gives initial life; Eucharist (blood) sustains life.

But more profoundly, it points to Eucharistic discipline - Catholics fast before receiving Holy Communion to honor Christ's Real Presence. Daniel ate simple food (vegetables and water) and was healthier; we receive simple elements (bread and wine) that become the source of eternal health. Daniel wouldn't compromise even in food; Catholics believe it matters what we receive - the Eucharist is not symbolic but truly Jesus.
