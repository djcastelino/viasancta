## Notes

### Miracles You Have (No Need to Add):
- ✓ **Bruges** - You have it (year 1256, website shows 1203 - same miracle, year variation)
- ✓ **Liège** - You have it (year 1246 Corpus Christi, website shows 1374 - might be 2 separate miracles)
- ✓ **Gorkum-El Escorial** - You have it
- ✓ **Thomas Aquinas** - You have it ("Apparition of Christ to St. Thomas Aquinas")
- ✓ **Francis of Assisi** - You have it ("Miracle of the Devoted Lambs")
- ✓ **Germaine Cousin** - You have it ("Eucharistic Miracle of Pibrac")
- ✓ **Margaret Mary Alacoque** - You have it ("Revelations of the Sacred Heart of Jesus")
- ✓ **Bernard of Clairvaux** - You have it ("Eucharistic Miracle of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux")

### Additional Consideration:
The **Liège miracle** might actually be TWO separate miracles:
- 1246: Institution of Feast of Corpus Christi (you have this)
- 1374: Separate Eucharistic miracle (website lists this specifically)

If Liège 1374 is a separate miracle, that would be an 8th missing one.
